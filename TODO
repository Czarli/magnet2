Todo
====
- save and load per-room options
  - hash the scripted options and store the hash,
    if hash mismatches what was loaded, don't apply the loaded version
- search through all plugins to make use of options
  - make plugins announce used options, tell whether option is known in core in !option
- make knowledge db accept unicode terms for some rooms
- short description for every command
- ensure it doesn't crash without admin privileges
- allow to join/leave rooms by bot owner request
- ensure it works on ejabberd, openfire, tigase
- add reasons for role/affiliation changes
- clarify "!what blah blah" to not to create impression spaces are supported
  or instead allow creating definitions as Magnet, a = b
- disable showing definitions to a person with unhandled emulated command syntax
- prevent nick changes for @gmail.com users
- merge database operations from plugins to Magnet API
- !version [target] showing user client version
- pisg-like stats!
  Count online record too, total number of messages, actions, commands,
  show time when the record started, time spent in the chat, etc


More ideas and suggestions
==========================
- Prevent caps kick backfiring when referring to caps nickname:
  "OMFGUSERNAME: hi"
- extend matchreply
  - matchkick to kick on regexp message match
  - (maybe) matchcounter to increment a counter then do action on counter limit
- maybe don't tell about added autokick if akicked was in the room,
  same for added automod
- !tell, !untell
  if it's executed in groupchat, send in groupchat, if in PM, send in PM.
  - Well some sort of list of all the tells you have currently sent
  - But a list of whom you've even 'told' would be nice too

- !botsnack?
- if user overuses commands, lock him for a few minutes

- make proper daemon process

- unicode filter, such as, telling the user to use English if too many non-English chars detected

- stats on databases (i.e. size, number of definitions)

- !timer <seconds> <reason> - reminder

- making Magnet identify all links, not only Youtube ones?
  For example, tell link title, format, size.
  <user posts a pic>
  <Magnet> user's link: 200 kb, PNG, 1024x768

- !achievement "So and so got so and so" +10g, it will be placed on a tally
  and with the command !achievements they can see what they've got in total
  and who has the most at the moment

- add jid or nick or regexp to watch list (assign ID to it and remove by ID)
  with a separate file for logging each watched item
